# MyWeigh - A Program Structure Comparison Tool

MyWeigh is a command-line tool designed to compare the structure of two program definition files, `program.json` and `program_structure.json`. This helps in identifying discrepancies or changes in the expected program structure.

## How to Run

Currently, MyWeigh is in its early stages of development. To run the comparison, you will need to:

1.  **Ensure you have the necessary JSON files:** Make sure `program.json` and `program_structure.json` are present in the root directory of the project.
2.  **Execute the comparison logic:** The core comparison logic is not yet fully implemented as a runnable script. The `todo.md` file indicates the next steps for development.

**Future Development:**

The goal is to provide a simple command-line interface to execute the comparison, potentially with options for output format and detailed reporting.

## Current Status

The `todo.md` file outlines the immediate development tasks:

*   `[] compare structure form program.json and program_structure.json`

This indicates that the primary comparison functionality is still pending implementation.
